PRs welcome! The CSS is pretty hacky, I depend on a component library called packard-belle & inline a bunch of stuff when I should really be writing these styles myself, there's `<div><div><div></div></div></div>`s everywhere, and it scales terribly on different screen sizes. <3 to anyone who contributes, PRs, bugs, and suggestions welcome! :)
